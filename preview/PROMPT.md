```
/i A dark fantasy background with an abstract, gnarled tree as the central or side element. The tree appears ancient and unnatural, with twisted branches and roots spreading across a surface of cracked stone or scorched earth. Around it are floating shards, glowing symbols, fragmented circles, tangled geometric lines, and other mysterious arcane shapes. The atmosphere is mystical, decayed, and symbolic â€” the tree represents forgotten logic or syntax. There are no characters or buildings. Rendered in a gothic, WarCraft-inspired style with high contrast, green and violet mist, and subtle magical light. Suitable as a background for a code-related project.
